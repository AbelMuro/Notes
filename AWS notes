========================================================== AMAZON S3 =================================================================================

Amazon Web Services S3 is an 'object' storage service that can be used to store data such as any type of files (text, image, video, etc...) and folders

S3 also has a REST API that is used by the back-end to make requests and receive responses from a bucket
S3 is mostly used for backup and storage. Useful for saving distinct copies of you data
S3 can also be used to host/deploy a static website
S3 is basically a NoSQL database

S3 uses Buckets and Objects. Buckets are containers for objects, and objects are files or any metadata that describes the file.

--Buckets consists of objects that are each identified by a key and a version ID (if S3 versioning is enabled on the bucket)

--Objects consist of object data and metadata

    metadata: a set of name and value pairs that describes the object, some of these pairs are default sets such as 'date last modified', and standard HTTP metadata (Content-Type)
            
    object data: can be any type of file; text, js, css, image, video, literally any file
    
    
    
--------------------------------------------HOW TO DEPLOY/HOST A WEBSITE WITH S3----------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Create a bucket in S3 console

2) set the following options for the bucket
    --ACL's disabled
    --unblock all public access
    
3) open the bucket and then click on properties

4) then scroll all the way down and click on the edit button in STATIC WEBSITE HOSTING

5) set the following options
    --enable
    --Host a static website
    --set the landing page for the website (index.html)

6) then click on permission for the bucket

7) click on add actions and then type in S3, then search for GetObject

8) Then click on Add a Resource, select object for the resource and type in the bucket name and replace {ObjectName} with *

9) Then on the policy json text, change the Principal value to "*"

10) Now all you have to do is import all the files in the /dist folder to the bucket (not the folder itself)

you can use the command line.. aws s3 sync ./dist s3://{name-of-bucket}

11) once everything is working properly, go back to properties and scroll all the way down and click on the link in static website hosting










================================================== AMAZON IAM =========================================================================

Amazon IAM is a way of controlling who has access to AWS resources. You can decide which users have permission to access.
You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources.

When you create a AWS account, you are given a 'root' user account that has ALL administrative access. However, 
it is strongly recommended to not use this root account for everyday tasks for security reasons. The Root user should 
only be used for actions that require the root user. For other trivial actions, an IAM account with MOST administrative access should be used










=============================================== HOW TO SETUP AWS CLI ====================================================================

1) Go to the IAM management console (not the identity center)

2) Select Users from the Access Management drop down on the left

3) Click on a user and make sure they have 'administrator access' permission, if they dont, then click on Add Permission button

4) Then Click on Security Credentials and scroll down until you see Access Key, then click on the Access Key button.

5) Save the Access Key ID and the secret access Key

6) then open up any terminal and type in 'aws configure', 
it will then ask you for the Access key ID, the secret key and the region, the output format doesnt matter right now

7) to test that everything is working, type in aws iam list-users
