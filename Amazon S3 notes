Amazon Web Services S3 is an 'object' storage service that can be used to store data
S3 is basically a NoSQL database

S3 uses Buckets and Objects. Buckets are containers for objects, and objects are files or any metadata that describes the file.


--Buckets consists of objects that are each identified by a key and a version ID (if S3 versioning is enabled on the bucket)

--Objects consist of object data and metadata

    metadata: a set of name and value pairs that describes the object, some of these pairs are default sets such as 'date last modified', and standard HTTP metadata (Content-Type)
