/* 
                    Webpack is a bundler that is used to bundle all of the dependecies of an application/website 
                    into one file, bundle.js. This file is then served by the server to the client.


                                                        BUNDLING PROCESS      
                      1) File Analysis 
                              The bundler will look for the entry point of the application (index.js) and will analyze all 
                              imports and dependencies used in the application. The bundler will also check for syntax errors 
                      
                      2) Dependency Graph:
                              Then the bundler starts a dependency graph by linking all the modules and
                              assets together. 
                      
                      3) Transpilation: 
                              Once the dependency graph is completed, the bundler will use babel to transpile any
                              JSX code used in the files. 
                      
                      4) Optimization: 
                               The bundler will implement tree-shaking, this is a process of removing any unused code
                               in the application. All whitespaces will be removed and variable names will be shortened to 
                               optimize the size of the file.

                      5) Bundling: 
                                Once the steps above have been completed, the bundle will bundle all the files into one 
                                file, bundle.js. If the developer implemented lazy-loading, the bundler will split the bundle.js
                                into multiple files, each file will be loaded on the browser when necessary
*/




//------------------------------- Initializing Webpack
/* 
    You can initialize webpack by creating a file named webpack with the extention
    config.js. In this file, you must export an object with the module.exports. The
    exported objects has all the properties that will configure webpack. 
    This file should always be at the root path of your project.

               npm install webpack --save-dev                                       //installs webpack core
               npm install webpack-cli --save-dev                                   //install webpack command line interface (terminal stuff)
               npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev 
    
*/

module.exports = {}




//------------------------------- Entry
/* 
    Entry is the directory of the index.js file. Webpack will start its 
    dependency graph based on this file, and will automatically figure 
    out which modules depend on this file. You can also pass an object 
    to specify multiple entry points, this is useful for multi-page applications
*/

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  entry: {
      about: './src/about.js',
      contact: './src/contact.js',
  }
}




//------------------------------- Output
/* 
    Output describes the details of the bundle.js file that is
    generated by webpack after we start the bundling process.
    The output property accepts an object with the following properties

              path:     path is the directory of the bundle.js
              filename:   filename is the name of the bundle.js (can be any name)
              publicPath:  publicPath is the base path for all assets. This tells webpack where to look when you reference files (images, fonts, ect..) within import statements
              clean:     clean accepts a boolean value that tells webpack to remove old files in the output directory before generating new ones
              assetModuleFilename:   assetModuleFilename defines the naming convention for all files that are processed by webpack. [name][ext]
*/

const path = require('path');    

module.exports = {
      output: {                                             
        path: path.join(__dirname, '/dist'),  
        filename: 'bundle.js',                
        publicPath: '/',
        clean: true,
        assetModuleFilename: '[name][ext]',
    },
}







//------------------------------- DevServer
/* 
    The devServer property can be used to configure the development server
    used by webpack

          static: ''                    static defines the directory where files should be included in your dev server (public folder or any folder that has files that are not explicitly imported in your project)
          compress: boolean             compress enables the compression of files in the project for faster load times.         
          port: ''                      port specifies the port number for the server.         
          hot: boolean                  hot enables Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for live updates everytime there is a change in one of the files.        
          open: boolean                 open automatically opens the browser when the server starts.       
          historyApiFallback:           historyApiFallback helps with routing in our react app, everytime we refresh the page, react router will send a request to the dev server, but this property will make sure it searches for an index file first              
          allowedHosts: ['locahost', 'myDomain.com', 'all']   allowedHosts lets certain domains access the dev server (if you type http://'myDomain.com in the browser, you will be able to visit the website from the dev server)
          watchFiles: ['src/**/*.html']              Watches specific files for changes and triggers reloads.    ** means all folders in between, * means all file names    
/*        proxy: {                      proxy will forward all API requests made to an endpoint to a different URL
              '/': {                                          http://localhost:3000/login

          https: {                      https can enable the dev server to connect to back end services with https, instead of http (setting this value to true will create a self-signed certificate, passing an object will create a trusted certificate)

          client: {                     Configures how console-logging is done by webpack (error messages, warning messages, etc..)
              logging: ''                  Defines which type of logs will be shown in the browser console ('verbose' (detailed), 'info', 'warn', 'error', or 'none').

              overlay: {                   Shows the console-logs done by webpack directly in the browser as an overlay. 
                  error: true,                    will show error messages in the overlay
                  warnings: true                  will show warning messages in the overlay
              }                             
              webSocketURL: {              Configures the websocket used by webpack for live reloading (you should use this property if you are running webpack in a non-localhost enviroment)
                  hostname: "localhost",          hostname can be a custom domain (myexample.com),    defaults to 'localhost'
                  port: 8080,                     port used by webpack,    defaults to the same port as the dev server
                  pathname: "/ws",                specifying endpoint used for the websocket,    defaults to '/ws'
                  protocol: "ws"                  ws or wss,    defaults to the protocol used by the dev server (http or https)
