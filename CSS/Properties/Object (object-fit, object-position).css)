        this is especially useful when we want to display a certain part of the image when 
        the image is either too zoomed-in due to object-fit:cover or if its clipped due to object-fit: none.
        'Object-Position' can also be useful if we have object-fit: contain, because it will usually create
        a content-box bigger than the resized verson of the image
