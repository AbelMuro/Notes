            Web Real Time Connection (webRTC) is a continuous connection between two clients(instances) of an application.
            You need a signaling mechanism that can be used to create a signal from one client to another one.
            Websockets are a good way to create a signaling mechanism, look in the Node.js notes for more info.     



                                                HANDSHAKE   
                                                
            For two clients to connect, they must exchange their Session Description Protocol (SDP). 
            SDP is a format that describes the media capabilities (video, audio, resolutions, bandwidth), 
            the IP address, ports, and network settings of the client. The SDP format looks like the following

                                    v=0
                                    o=- 123456 654321 IN IP4 192.168.1.10            // session ID
                                    s=WebRTC Call                                   
                                    c=IN IP4 203.0.113.1                             // public IP address
                                    t=0 0                                                
                                    m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 96                         // media details (audio/video, port, codec)
                                    a=rtpmap:96 opus/48000/2                         // atttributes (codec details like opus)

            1) The local client creates a RTCPeerConnection() object

            2) The local client calls the .createDataChannel() method to create a channel that can be 
               used between two clients to connect to each other

            3) The local client calls .createOffer() method to generate its SDP 

            4) The local client calls .setLocalDescription() method to declare that the SDP belongs to the local client.

            5) The local client sends the SDP object returned from .createOffer() through the websocket.

            6) The remote client receives the SDP object and calls the .setRemoteDescription() method to declare that 
               the received SDP object belongs to the local client.

            7) The remote client calls the .createAnswer() method to generate its SDP

            8) The remote client calls the .setLocalDescription() method to declare that the SDP belongs to the remote client.

            9) The remote client sends the SDP object returned from .createAnswer() through the websocket

            10) The local client receives the SDP object and calls the .setRemoteDescription() method to declare that
               the received SDP object belongs to the remote client

            11) Once both clients have exchanges SDP information, each client will begin gathering ICE candidates



                                                ICE candidate gathering
                                                
             Once the initial handshake is done and both clients exchanged SDP information,  they will exchange
             Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) candidate information. Each candidate is a potential 
             network path that both clients can use to create a connection with each other. Below are some examples 
             of ICE candidates.

                         Local Network (private IP address)                  // device was able to find its own IP address
                         STUN server (public IP discovery)                   // device was NOT able to find its own IP address, so the STUN server helps find it
                         TURN server (relay if connection fails)             // a server that is used as a middleman between the two clients, it receives the message from one client and sends it to the other client

            1) Both clients will start ICE gathering and will send the all ICE candidates through the websocket

            2) The clients will receive the ICE candidate from each other and use the .addIceCandidate() method
               to see if both clients can connect to each other with the candidate

//---------------------------- RTCPeerConnection()
/* 
            In javascript, we have the RTCPeerConnection API that can be used to create a connection between two clients.
            You must instantiate this class by providing a STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) server url 
            and a TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) server URL

                STUN: a server that helps devices discover their public IP address and port, which is useful when they are 
                      behind a NAT (Network Address Translation) router. These type of routers allow multiple devices to share
                      a single public IP address, and this will be a problem for the peer-to-peer communication. 
                      Peer-to-peer requires the unique public IP address of the device to create the connection.
    
                TURN: a server that steps in when direct peer-to-peer communication isnâ€™t possible due to restrictive 
                      network conditions. It acts as an middle-man, relaying data between the two clients 
                      to ensure connectivity.

            Methods and properties of RTCPeerConnection:


                        .createOffer()                           
                        .setLocalDescription()                  // this method will set the Session Description Protocol(SDP) of the local client. 
                                                                   The SDP contains information about the media capabilities (audio, video, resolutions, bandwidth limits),
                                                                   connection details (IP address and port), and network settings of the local client
                                                                   
                        
                        .setRemoteDescription()                 // this method will configure the connection of the local client based on the SDP of the remote client
                        .createAnswer()
                        
                        .addIceCandidate()
                
*/

        const peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection({
            iceServers: [
                { urls: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' },            // you can use the free public STUN server that is provided by google
                {
                    urls: process.env.TURN_SERVER,                   // you can create a free TURN server in    https://www.expressturn.com/#dashboard
                    username: process.env.TURN_USERNAME,
                    credential: process.env.TURN_CREDENTIAL
                }
            ]
        });









//---------------------------- Signaling Mechanism
/* 
      For the peer-to-peer connection to work, there must be some kind of signal mechanism that starts 
      the connection process. We can use a websocket for this. All clients that are connected to the
      websocket will receive a 'signal' or 'message' from the websocket that a specific client wants 
      to connect. The following function is how you can implement the websocket, but you need to make 
      changes to the function to ensure that the signal is received by a certain client and not ALL clients.

                  function CreateWebSocket(path = 'signaling') {
                        try{
                            const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ noServer: true });
                            global.webSocketHandlers[`/${path}`] = wss;
                    
                            wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
                                console.log('Front-end and back-end are connected, waiting to initiate signal to clients');
                            
                                ws.on('message', (message) => {
                                    wss.clients.forEach(client => {
                                        if(client !== ws && client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN)               
                                            client.send(message);   
                                    })
                                })
                            });
                        }
                        catch(error){
                            const message = error.message;
                            console.log(message);
                        }
                    }      
*/

const signalingServer = new WebSocket('look in node.js notes for more info on websockets');

signalingServer.onmessage = async (message) => {
              const text = await message.data.text();
              const data = JSON.parse(text);
          
              if(data.type === 'offer' && peerConnection.signalingState === 'stable') {               //we handle a connection here (when a local client wants to connect to a remote client)
                  await peerConnection.setRemoteDescription(new RTCSessionDescription(data.offer));       //we create a remote description of the offer  (remote description are the connection settings of the OTHER peer)

                  signalingServer.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'answer', answer }));                       //we send the answer to the websocket
              }
