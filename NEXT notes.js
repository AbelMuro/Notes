/*  Next.js is a framework for React. A framework is a collection of pre-written JavaScript code libraries 
        that provide developers with pre-written JS code to use for routine programming features and tasks

    Next.js has client-side routing, the pages folder automatically creates a URL for each js file
    Next.js has pre-fetching, when a Link component is on the view port, Next.js will pre-load the page in the background before the user clicks on the link
    Next.js does code-splitting automatically, so each page only loads whatâ€™s necessary for that page 
    Next.js has built in support for CSS and SASS
    Next.js has on-demand image optimization, This allows for resizing, optimizing, and serving images in modern formats like WebP when the browser supports it.
    Next.js lazy loads images by default

    steps for initializing Next.js
    
    1) npm init -y
    
    2) npm install --save react react-dom next
    
    3) use the following scripts for package.json
    
          "dev": "next dev",
          "build": "next build",
          "start": "next start",
          "lint": "next lint"
          
    4) create a pages folder in the root of the directory and create an index.js
    
          pages
             index.js               /
             posts
                first-post.js      /posts/first-post
                second-post.js     /posts/second-post
             about-me              /about-me

      5) create a public folder in the root of the directory (this will be used for static files, images, icons, etc..)
