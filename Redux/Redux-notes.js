                                                         FEATURES OF REDUX

                                                       STATE UPDATES PROCESS 
            All state updates in Redux behave asynchronously, and all re-renders behave asynchronously.
            Redux will batch all the synchronous dispatch() calls, and wait until the callstack is empty to apply the state updates
            and the re-render. If the callstack has an asynchronous function (fetch, Redux-Thunk), then all the batched dispatch()
            calls will trigger the state update and cause a re-render BEFORE the asynchronous function is taken out of the callstack.
            
                                                            ARCHITECTURE
            Redux has an architecture that consists of waiting for an event to be triggered in the UI by the user. This event
            will dispatch an action to the reducer. The reducer will use the action to return a new updated state. Redux will then 
            compare the new returned state with the old state, if they differ, then Redux will re-render all components that are 
            subscribed to the store. Redux's architecture follows a similar approach to the FLUX architecture but with some differences. 
            Flux has multiple stores, but Redux has a single store. Flux uses a dispatcher to receive actions from the application and 
            then sends them to its stores, but Redux allows the application to directly send the actions to the store.
            
                                                                STORE
            The store in Redux is a centralized object that represents the single source of truth. The entire state object of the application
            is stored here, and any components subscribed to the store will be re-rendered when the state is updated.

                                                              GLOBAL STATE
            The global state is the applications entire state object, it is stored within the Store and updated by the Reducer. This
            state should only have serializable data (objects, arrays, primitive values). Any non-serializable values will not be safely stores
            (non-serializable = you will lose some data if you use JSON.parse(JSON.stringify()))

                                                                REDUCER
            The reducer is a function within the Store that is responsible for updating the global state. The reducer will not 
            mutate the global state directly, instead it will return a new global state. Redux will compare the new state with the 
            old state, and if the states are different, then a re-render will occur. It is because of this reason the global state 
            should never be mutated directly. If the global state is mutated directly within the global store and returned, Redux will 
            compare the old state with the old state, as a result, Redux will not trigger a re-render.

                                                                ACTIONS
            Actions are objects that contain new data that will be dispatched to the reducer. The reducer will use these actions
            to update the global state. Actions will typically follow the following format...

                                                const action = {
                                                    type: 'UPDATE_NAME',
                                                    payload: 'new name'
                                                }






         STEPS TO INTEGRATE REDUX INTO YOUR REACT APPLICATION 
         
                  0)  npm install redux                        //install the core files for redux
                      npm install react-redux                  //installs the library that react uses to work with redux
                      npm install @reduxjs/toolkit             //installs other useful functions/methods for state management
                      
                  1) create a folder called './store' with the file store.js
          
                  2) store.js will have the following boilerplate code
                
                              import {configureStore} from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
                              import Reducer from './Reducers';
                  
                              const store = configureStore({                      //this will create the store with a reducer
                                  reducer: Reducer,
                                  middleware: (getDefaultMiddleware) => getDefaultMiddleware({serializableCheck: false})                      //you may need to use this if you are storing unserializable data in the store
                              })
                  
                              export default store;
                      
                   3) then create another folder inside './store' and name it './Reducers'. Then place the file 'Reducers.js' inside of it
          
                   4) Reducers.js will have the following boilerplate code
                
                              import { createAction, createReducer } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
                              
                              const increment = createAction('counter/increment')
                              const decrement = createAction('counter/decrement')
                              const incrementByAmount = createAction('counter/incrementByAmount')
                              const initialState = { value: 0 }
                              
                              const counterReducer = createReducer(initialState, (builder) => {       //builder, as the name implies, is an object that builds the reducer with .addCase
                                builder
                                  .addCase(increment, (state, action) => {                            //the 'case'
                                    state.value++
                                  })
                                  .addCase(decrement, (state, action) => {
                                    state.value--                         
                                  })
                                  .addCase(incrementByAmount, (state, action) => {
                                    state.value += action.payload
                                  })
                              })
                  
                              export default counterReducer;
          
          
                   5) Go to your app.js and import the following
          
                              import {Provider} from 'react-redux';
                              import store from './store';
                              
                              function App() {
                                   return(
                                         <Provider store={store}>
                                               
                                          </Provider>
                                   )

//================================================= MIDDLEWARE ==============================================
/* 
            Middleware can be used to interact with a action object BEFORE it dispatches to the reducer
            redux provides pre built middlewares such as redux-thunk and redux-promise
            
            Custom middlewares are basically 3 functions that are nested within each other
            the 'action' function returns the action that is scheduled to be dispatched. 
            then 'next' function is used to dispatch the action to the reducer or to the next middleware
            the 'store' function is just there to help us access the state before and after the action is dispatched

*/

const myMiddleware = store => next => action => {
    console.log(store.getState());          //this will log the state BEFORE the action is dispatched to the reducer
    next(action);                           //we call this function to dispatch the action to the reducer or next middleware
    console.log(store.getState());          //this will log the state AFTER the action is dispatched to the reducer
}    

//think of it like this...
 function myMiddleware(store){
    return function(next){
        //once the function below is done with the action object, 
        //the function above will send the action object to the reducer
        return function(action){
            //we do something with the action object
        }
    }
 }

 //adding a new middleware to our store
const store = configureStore({              
    reducer: rootReducer,                   
    middleware: (getDefaultMiddleware) => getDefaultMiddleware().concat(myMiddleware)

//=================================================REDUX TESTING WITH JEST=================================================
//KEEP IN MIND THAT THE TESTING MUST BE INSIDE A TEST.JS

//npm install --save-dev jest
//npm install --save-dev babel-jest

//include the following in the babelrc. file
{
    "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"]
}

//also add the script below to your package.json file
{
    "script": {
        "test": "jest",
    }
}



//-----------------------------testing action creators----------------------------------
//you can have as many it(), expect().toEqual() as you want

// ./test.js
import action from './src/actionCreators/addOrRemoveItem'

describe('actions', () => {                                         //the first argument will appear in the terminal
    it('this is a message that will appear in terminal', ()=> {     
        const expectedAction = {                                    //we create an object that we expect will be the output of an action creator
            type: "add item",
            item: "big mac"
        }
        //this is where the test actually happens, we want action() to equal to expectedAction
        expect(action("add item", "big mac")).toEqual(expectedAction);//we call the action creator and compare it to expectedAction
    })
})

//then run the script in your package.json file,
//   npm run test
    


//------------------------you can also test reducers------------------------------------
import reducer from './src/reducers/reducer'

    it("should return the initial state", () => {
        expect(reducer(undefined, {})).toEqual(                         //reducer(undefined, {}) will return the initial state
            {
                order: []
            }
        )
    })
    it("should add the item to the store", ()=>{
        //here we are initializing state with the first argument and passing the action object
        expect(reducer({order: []}, {type: "add item", item: "big mac"})).toEqual({order: ["big mac"]})
    })
