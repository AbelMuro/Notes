                                      SERVICE WORKERS

  Service Workers are programs that enable your app to work even when there is no internet connection.  
  These programs are required to make a PWA (progressive web app) and they intercepting network requests 
  and caches them so that they can be used offline

  Cache is the technique of storing resources (images, files, etc...) for offline use 
  
  Remember, you will also need to install a manifest.json file in the 
  public folder of you project to make your app into a PWA
  Check the manifest notes.js repository for more info

//  -----------------------Remember to save this file 'ServiceWorker.js' into the public folder of your project (outside the src folder)-------------------------------

1)  // Install service worker 
    // (we open a cache, add specified resources to it, and ensures that the installation process doesnâ€™t complete until the cache is ready)

      self.addEventListener('install', e => {
          e.waitUntil(                                                //waitUntil() is a method that tells the browser that work is ongoing until the promise that is passed is settled
            caches.open('Quiz app cache')                             //caches.open() is a method that opens up the browser caches
              .then((cache) => {                                      // cache is an object that we can use to access the cache
                return cache.addAll(['/', '/styles.css', '/app.js']);  //we update the cache with these resources
              })

                                        const cloneResponse = response.clone(); //we have to clone the response because the response stream can only be consumed once

                                              })
