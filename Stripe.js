    Steps to install stripe into your app

          (go to the top left corner of the dashboard and select 'create new account')

      1) brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe for mac

         install the stripe_X.X.X_windows_x86_64.zip file from the stripe github repo for windows
         unzip the file and save the file in a place you will remember 
         then run the following commands in the command prompt
         
         cd path/to/directory/that/has/stripe.exe
         
         then run the commands below...

      2) stripe login                    //this will open up the browser, enabling you to login

      3) stripe plugin install apps      //you can create apps with this plugin

      4) stripe apps create name-of-app  //this will create apps by opening up the browser and asking you to select a 'store' in stripe that you can use to keep the app
