//ngrok enables you to create a url that displays what you are currently working on in localhost:8080
//keep in mind that you must have localhost:8080 already running a dev server for ngrok's url to work

//step 1: go to ngrok.com and install the ngrok terminal

//step 2: run ngrok config add-authtoken 2GsG4xYbupQXSCtjwXKPV9RdgC3_3CBD8bQ4JJVdLfcvZ2scZ
//        this will sign you in with your authentication token

//step 3: ngrok http --host-header=rewrite 8080 (for webpack dev servers)

//step 4: if you are using firebase auth with ngrok, you must put the url that ngrok gives you into the authorized domain list
